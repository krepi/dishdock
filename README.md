## Running the Project Locally

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system.

### Setting Up

1. Clone the project repository.
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate into the project directory.
   ```
   cd project-directory
   ```
3. Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and adjust the settings to your local environment.
   ```
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

### Starting the Application with Docker

1. Build and start the containers.
   ```
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
2. After the build completes, the application should be accessible at `http://localhost:3000` (or another port if you've configured it differently).

### Database Migrations

To set up your PostgreSQL database schema, you may need to run migrations. This can typically be done within the app container:
```
docker-compose exec backend npm run migrate
```
