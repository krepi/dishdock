# Culinary Application

## Introduction

This culinary application aims to revolutionize how users explore, view, and save recipes for their culinary adventures. Integrating with the Spoonacular API, it provides a vast array of recipes for users to discover. Developed using a microservices architecture with a React frontend, this application offers scalability, maintainability, and a seamless user experience.
